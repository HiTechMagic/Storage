This is a set of .Net Standard libraries designed to provide access to file (and other) storage in a very generic _storage-agnostic_ way.

## Initial design includes support for the following Storage environments
- Local file storage
- Embedded resource files (read only for obvious reasons)
- Azure blob storage

## Additional storage providers could include
- Email servers
- FTP & SFTP servers
